# RoastArena

**Roast. Compete. Earn.**

RoastArena is an AI-powered competitive creator platform where founders create roast challenges backed by real GEN prize pools, creators submit their funniest and most savage roasts, and GenLayer Intelligent Contracts judge every submission through AI consensus before automatically rewarding the winners.

---

## The Problem

Creative competitions are everywhere in Web3.

Projects run content contests, meme campaigns, writing competitions, and bounty programs. Creators spend hours producing work, only for winners to be selected by a founder, community manager, or small judging committee.

The process is often:

* Subjective
* Opaque
* Difficult to verify
* Vulnerable to favoritism

Participants rarely know why one submission won over another.

RoastArena explores a different model.

Instead of relying on human judges, challenges are evaluated by GenLayer Intelligent Contracts using AI consensus. Every submission is scored against transparent criteria, every result is reproducible, and rewards are distributed automatically.

---

## How It Works

1. A founder creates a roast challenge and deposits GEN into the prize pool.
2. Creators submit roast entries before the challenge deadline.
3. Once the challenge ends, the founder triggers AI judging.
4. GenLayer validators independently evaluate every roast.
5. Consensus is formed on the scores.
6. Winners are ranked automatically.
7. Prize pool rewards are distributed to the top performers.

## AI Judging Criteria

Every roast receives a score from 0 to 100 across five dimensions.

| Category    | Weight | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Humor       | 30%    | How funny and entertaining the roast is        |
| Creativity  | 20%    | How clever and imaginative the approach is     |
| Originality | 20%    | How unique and unexpected the roast feels      |
| Savagery    | 20%    | How hard the roast lands                       |
| Relevance   | 10%    | How closely it relates to the challenge prompt |

Final score:

Overall = (Humor × 0.3) + (Creativity × 0.2) + (Originality × 0.2) + (Savagery × 0.2) + (Relevance × 0.1)

The AI also generates reasoning explaining each score.

## Why Roasts?

Humor is one of the hardest things for AI to evaluate.

A good roast requires:

* Context awareness
* Creativity
* Timing
* Originality
* Understanding of culture and language

If GenLayer can reach consensus on something as subjective as comedy, it demonstrates the potential for decentralized AI evaluation across many other forms of creative work.

RoastArena is therefore both a game and a proof-of-concept for trustless creative judging.
